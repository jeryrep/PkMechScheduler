# PkMechScheduler
This is a proof of concept project used to demonstrate possibility of web scraping schedule 
from [Faculty of Mechanical Engineering](https://mech.pk.edu.pl/) of 
[Cracow University of Technology](https://www.pk.edu.pl/) schedule [site](https://podzial.mech.pk.edu.pl/).
You can find here MechScraper library which performs various operations on this site to get schedule in
form of lists so they can be easily shown on some frontend application.  
PkMechScheduler.Frontend is a .NET MAUI app used to show how it could be done. I wouldn't call this app
production ready (since MAUI has some issues) and is used only as proof of concept. I encourage students
of Faculty of Mechanical Engineering to fork this repository and make this app better as it's MIT licensed.  
Feel free to reach me out in case of any questions.
